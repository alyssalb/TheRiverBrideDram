    <h2>Culture and Myth in <i>The River Bride</i></h2>
    <h3>El Boto, Encantados, and Transformation</h3>
      <p>El Boto, or the pink river dolphin myth, refers to a folk story about dolphins taking on a human form, both male and female, and seducing humans. Some of these stories portray the dolphins as malicious, with male dolphins impregnating unmarried women and then fleeing back to the river. In many stories both male and female dolphin-people lure human victims back to the river to take them to their Encante (underwater realm) or to drown them. The dolphins are a type of Encantado, enchanted immortal beings who live in the river in the Encante.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://thenib.com/legend-of-the-boto-cor-de-rosa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"The first mentions of the boto date back to the end of the 18th century, when Europeans had established themselves in the region after a violent process of colonization...from colonial times to mid-19th century, Brazilian legal structures were extremely patriarchal. Women had little to no autonomy - they had very limited options for work and were banned from attending school."</a></li>
        </ul>
      <p>  El Boto is not an isolated myth, as most mythology is not exclusive to a singular region, culture, or story. Adrian Burton discusses global myths around dolphins while considering their proximity to humans in nature and intelligence. In a number of fascinating explorations, he discusses:
        <ul>
          <li>The lore of the Chumash Native Americans in California that tells of their people in the past saved by a deity from drowning by being turned into dolphins, and so considering dolphins to be kin.</li>
          <li>Southeastern Australian Wurundjeri people and some Southern New Zealand Maori tribes who position dolphins as an afterlife form for humans.</li>
          <li>Northern Australian Groote Eylandt myths where dolphins become human.</li>
          <li>Micronesian Onotoa Island peoples' myths about female dolphins seeking a human man and being killed by humans. In some stories, the man they sought saves, hides, and falls in love with them, and the pair must convince the village elders that all dolphins were once human to be allowed to marry.</li>
          <li>The pink river dolphin of the Amazon river systems, who disguises itself as a man and is seductive, "dashingly dressed in white and [an] excellent dancer[]".</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Orta uses the Encantado in the play (Moises) to explore both the fear of the unknown and the desire for freedom and transformation.</p>
      <p>Candace Slater discusses Encantados and their world in the river as culturally flexible stories that respond to societal, ecological, economic, and population related changes across the Amazon rivers' inhabitants. Some insight into the potential motivation of both the Encantado (Moises) and those attracted to or wary of him for various reasons (our human characters):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>"Neither fully animal nor fully human, their tenacious in-between-ness provides a generally unwelcome reminder that what looks deeply familiar may be a mirage."</li>
          <li>"Shifting representations of the Amazon...respond to an increasing number of government policies that seek to foster the development of the Brazilian Amazon without totally abandoning...concerns for environmental preservation and indigenous rights."</li>
          <li>"These shifting ideas of the Amazon have also found their way into traditional stories of enchantment, which increasingly serve as evaluations of the present in relation to the past...[and] increase[] these stories' already-existing emphasis on loss and transformation."</li>
        </ul>
      <p>Scott Williams Hoefle adds additional perspectives, and says that in interviewing Amazon river inhabitants from a variety of backgrounds, he found "a rich lore of human-like spirits of the forests and rivers, of enchanted animals temporarily transformed into humans who do evil, of humans temporarily transformed into monstrous animals that attack people, and of divine interference with worldly affairs." Of the river dolphin myth, he has to say the following: 
          <ul>
            <li>"They are characterized as being mean-spirited and wicked...[they] place[] young maidens into a trance in order to seduce and impregnate them. An affected woman must be physically restrained or else she will jump into the river and accompany her dolphin lover down to his underwater abode, from which she will never return."</li>
            <li>"Disbelievers jokingly comment that the dolphin was invented to explain unwanted pregnancy and to avoid paying child support. The belief in dolphins thus serves to project conflict outside of a small communnity, where all present are kin and friends, by placing blame for randy behaviour on the dolphin, who is outside the limits of proper civility."</li>
          </ul>
            </p>

    <h3>Comparative Myths from Around the World</h3>
    <p>There are many similar myths surrounding human and water spirit/creature relationships and seductions globally. Some such myths include: 
    <ul>
      <li><b>Selkie - Celtic and Norse Origin</b>; Selkies are seals that can shed their skin and become human. They are very sweet and often tragic figures, with "romantic" stories involving human men stealing the selkie's sealskin to trap her and force a marriage. Selkies yearn for the sea, and will leave their human families if they can find their sealskin and return home.</li>
      <li><b>Mermaid/Siren - Greek and European Origin</b>; Half-human and half-fish beings that are often associated with great aesthetic and vocal beauty, which they use to enchant humans. These stories often find the mermaid or siren luring sailors to death by drowning. Many stories, such as <i>The Little Mermaid</i>, center on mermaids falling in love with humans and sacrificing their life in the ocean (and sometimes, their lives period).</li>
      <li><b>Rusalka - Slavic Origin</b>; Rusalka are malicious water spirits, fish women who hate men. In some versions of the myth, they are tragic human figures who commit suicide or are murdered due to abusive relationships, unrequited love, or unwanted pregnancy. These drowning deaths produce the undead rusalka, whose main purpose is to lure young men to their deaths by seducing them into the water with their aesthetic and vocal beauty. We see traces of this tale in early versions of <i>The Little Mermaid</i> as well, in which she turns to foam afer losing the affections of the man she became human for. See also <i>The Lure</i>, a modern polish musical horror film adaptation by Agnieszka Smoczynska.</li>
      <li><b>Kelpie - Scottish Origin</b>; Kelpie generally take the form of horses, and can transform into attractive human men. In horse-form, they lure children to drown. In human form, predictably, they use their beauty to seduce and drown human women, sometimes also eviscerating them.</li>
      <li><b>Melusine - French Origin</b>; A river spirit that is human on top and fish on the bottom, very similar to mermaids. Stories follow patterns of romance with humans followed by conditional human acceptance and rejection of their "monstrous" fish form. This spirit is not portrayed as inherently malevolent, which like the selkie complicate the malicious seducer narrative we see in many of these water spirit folk tales. This complication might be useful for us in this very nuanced play.</li>
      <li><b>Nacken - Nordic Origin</b>; Male water spirits that play music to lure women and children to drown. Some stories paint them as harmless, however, and some even include inter-species marriage with humans. Like the selkie, the Nacken or NÃ¸kk yearns for its home and eventually returns to the water.</li>
