<h2>Dramaturgy Note</h2>
<p>Hello, cast and crew of <i>The River Bride</i> at UCF.</p>
<p>My name is Alyssa Barrack, I'll be your dramaturg for this production. I am so excited to dig into this rich and emotionally impactful world with you all. This website/packet is meant to act as a research starter and reference document for us all as we work through the play over the next couple of months. When specific questions and conversations come up, feel free to ask for clarification or more information at any time. We will find the answers together!
  </p>
<p>I am available at alyssa.barrack@ucf.edu, or you can catch me before or after rehearsal. Let's get ready to have some great conversations!
