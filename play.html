    <h2>About the Playwright</h2>
      <p>"Marisela Trevi√±o Orta is an accidental playwright. She found her way to the genre while completing an MFA in writing at the University of San Francisco where she studied poetry exclusively. While a student at USF, Marisela became the Resident Poet of <i>El Teatro Jornalero!</i>, a social justice theatre company comprised of Latino immigrants."

    <h3>The Grim Latinx Fairy Tale Cycle</h3>
        <p>The trilogy starts with <i>The River Bride</i> and also includes <i>Wolf at the Door</i> and <i>Alcira</i>.</p>
        <p>"Inspired by Latina/o mythology and fairy tales from Europe, the plays in this cycle are cautionary tales for adults to help us navigate our emotional lives. Like the Brothers Grimm's fairy tales, these plays are dark, violent, and love is complicated."
        - <a href="https://50playwrights.org/2016/04/07/marisela-trevino-orta-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Orta</a>
          </p>
        <p>Orta says that "writing <i>The River Bride</i> I found myself returning to my roots as a poet. Of all my plays it has the most heightened language...my poetics are very present in my playwriting -- lyricism, imagery, metaphor. And I consider myself an Imagist -- inspired by and using strong imagery as part of my narratives." - <a href="https://50playwrights.org/2016/04/07/marisela-trevino-orta-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Orta</a></p>
